## Assignment : Course Project Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This is part of developing data products assignment from coursera.

The project consists in two activities:

* Create a Shiny application : I used an example from tutorial from rstudio.github.io on shiny on inputs-and-outputs.
* Create a presentation in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to pitch for the application.


  
## load data sets
```{r,echo= TRUE }

summary(mtcars)
```


## Slide with data table
The main idea of the application is to provide usefule interface for mtcars data. It could be use for testing different application where requires relevant information.

## Slide with plot and visualization
```{r,echo= TRUE }
hist(mtcars$mpg, breaks=12, xlab="miles per gallon", main="mpg histogram", col="blue")
```
